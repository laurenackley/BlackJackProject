#**BlackJack Project**

##**Description**
Classic game of Blackjack without the risk of losing money by betting! If you are like me and very terrible with gambling, this is the version you want.
Game starts by dealing two cards. One card to the player, one to the dealer which is not shown. Once both cards are dealt, the player can see their two cards and the total, but can only view the last card dealt to the dealer and not dealers total.
From there, if you get 21 or Blackjack right away - congrats. You won and the game does not proceed. But if you are so unlucky as to bust immediately, the game also stops.
If neither conditions are met, then you can either hit or stay. If you bust then the game will stop, same if you hit blackjack. If your total is less than 21 you will still be asked if you want to continue. 
If the dealer has less than 17 total as a card value then he has to continue to draw cards. If dealer busts, you the player will win. If you tie, then congrats - neither lost.
It is a very fun take on blackjack.

###**Technologies Used**
 - Eclipse

###**What I learned**
I learned a lot the importance of testing and how it annoying it is when the testing is randomized and I don't control the outcome. That play button in Eclipse has to be worn out. I had a hard time with showing only the top card for the dealer. That was a lot of fun trying to figure out where it should change its type in either Hand, BlackJackHand, or Dealer. It was amazing when I finally got it sorted.
